  <p>The Ohio University Software Development Club provides a space for students to collaborate in an organized manner and work on projects relating to Software Development.  We aim to have groups of students work together in teams and mimic workplace style development.  The club will assist in organizing the teams and learning both hard and soft skills.  It will also give students a platform to publish their applications and receive recognition/profits from their application (if profitable).</p>
